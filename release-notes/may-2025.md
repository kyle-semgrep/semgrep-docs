# Semgrep release notes for [todoMONTH] 2025

<!-- Remember to update latest endpoint -->
<!-- Remember to update index page -->


## üåê Semgrep AppSec Platform
<!-- katie -->
- Fixed CI output so it shows per-product links depending on what product is enabled in a scan. (pr-3776)
## üíª Semgrep Code
<!-- sara -->

- Fix bug introduced in Semgrep 1.120.0 causing interfile analyses to run out of memory due to too many parallel jobs. The default setting had been accidentally set to the number of available CPUs which is often too much in interfile mode. It's now back to -j1 and it can be overridden by the user. (interfile-num-jobs)
- CLI: Fixed a bug where --disable-nosem was not properly causing nosemgrep'd findings
to be uploaded to the App. (saf-1982)
- pro: Improved handling of tsconfig.json in instances where multiple
typescript "projects" (i.e., separately rooted source directories with their
own configurations not joined by a single tsconfig.json with project
references) are being scanned as one project under semgrep. This should result
in better name/module resolution in TypeScript. (code-7798)
pro: Improved handling of include, exclude and files properties in
tsconfig.json. Projects which use more than one tsconfig in a given directory
which apply to different sets of files under that directory should see
improvements in name/module resolution. (code-7798-a)
Improved Supply Chain scan output and logging. (sc-2356)

## ‚õìÔ∏è Semgrep Supply Chain

- Exempt large manifests & lockfiles from being ignored by semgrep's file size filtering.
This fixes a regression introduced in 1.117.0 (sca-1705). (sc-1705)
